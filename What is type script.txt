<!-- First proram notes -->

//First code if we write hello word and console it using
//log and compile it using tsc main.ts
//command will create a file main.js which contain transpiled code.



//go in self created JS program.

 // As soon as we do tsc main.ts, firslty js file is created and our main.js file start giving an error.

// it will point error on message variable.

// This error happen bcz file is treated as script rather than module,module has its own scope and script shares global scope.

//to overcome this error we need to use export stateement at top, by using this export as module insted of script.

//so use export{} rest will autocomplete after we compoile the code using tsc main.ts

// to make ts compiler automaticallly watch when evr there is change in code run tsc main --watch
